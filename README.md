A Command line tumblr poster via selenium and ruby.

This is a tool in development to make posts to Tumblr via the command-line.
At this time it can log in and add a text post to the user's page or queue.

Next to be added istrue/false assertions.

Note: I realize this has little practical purpose as the Tumblr web UI is pretty good.
This is primarily a for fun project to add a selenium script to my portfolio.
